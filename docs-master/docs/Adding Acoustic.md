export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: color,
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>

        <li>Prefix: <code>~</code></li>
        <li><strong>You should probably click the big invite button ;)</strong></li>

## Authorization
---
### Step 1

Once you've decided to use the best **companion** on Discord, then you can continue to invite it to your fav server!

![Discord Authorization Screen](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth.webp)

Tap or click the `Select a server` button. A pop-up should appear that will let you select where you'd like to add Acoustic.


### Step two

Once you've selected the server that you'd like to add Acoustic to, you can press the `Continue` button on the bottom right of the menu.

You should now see something similar to this:

![Press authorize and you'll be good to go!](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth2.webp)

:::caution Note
If you want to disable `Administrator` permission from Acoustic, it will not work properly! You will still be able to listen to basic music features but some things won't work.

### Final Step

Once you press the `Authorize` button and complete the Captcha, you should be redirected to our thank-you page. In addition, you'll also see a message like the one below in your Discord server. **Spectacular!**

Now let's get the party started by [playing some songs](/play_song)!
