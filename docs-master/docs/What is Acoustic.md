### If you have no idea what you're doing here, then this short blurb is just for you!
---
Acoustic is a Discord bot for your community. We try to bridge the gap between multiple categories to bring you the best experience in music, economy and more.

# But Why Acoustic?
   - ### âœ¨ **Acoustic is constantly being updated**
     [Acoustic](https://acoustic.to/) offers so many [features](/commands) that we had to make another website just to show you them all! All of which improve your server and make a more engaging and immersive community.

   - ### ðŸ‘‹ **Dedicated support community**
     We are a relatively new bot to Discord so we wanted to make a big splash! Ensuring that the community has everything that it needs is of paramount importance to us. If you **ever** have any questions, drop us a line in our [Discord server](https://acoustic.to/support).
