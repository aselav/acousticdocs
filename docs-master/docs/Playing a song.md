After [inviting Acoustic into your server](/adding_acoustic), you can get the party started! To begin playing songs through Acoustic, follow this guide:


## 1. Join a Voice Channel.
  - You can do that by clicking on the channel with a speaker icon.

  </Tabs>

:::caution When playing a playlist:
  - Make sure the playlist is either `Unlisted` or `Public`. If it is set to `Private`, Acoustic won't be able to play that specific playlist.
